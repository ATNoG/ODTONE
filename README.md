Project : ODTONE - Open Dot Twenty ONE

Version : 0.6 Beta

URL     : http://atnog.av.it.pt/odtone/


Description
-----------

ODTONE is an open source implementation of the Media Independent Handover
framework from the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover Services standard,
providing a complete implementation of the IEEE 802.21 mechanisms required to
deploy and operate an MIH framework. In addition, it provides an infrastructure
that facilitates the interface with different link technologies, as well as to
ease its extension with new mechanisms and integration opportunities. Besides
the implementation of the IEEE 802.21 mechanisms, ODTONE aims to implement a
MIHF that is capable of being deployed in multiple operating systems. The OS
independence is achieved by using the Boost libraries, which allow the network
work-level operations and the definition of datatypes that are
system-independent.

In the release we provide not only the MIHF but also several Link SAPs and
MIH-Users. More info can be found
[here](http://atnog.github.io/ODTONE/documentation/odtone/app.html).

How do I get started?
---------------------

Instructions for compiling and installing the software switch can be found in
the [documentation](http://atnog.github.io/ODTONE/documentation/index.html).

If you want to get a fast hands on, try the pre-built packages, which includes
the MIHF, several Link SAPs and MIH-Users.

External contributors
---------------------

If you want to contribute code, please try to:

1. Follow the same coding style as used in the project. Pay attention to the
   usage of tabs, spaces, newlines and brackets. Try to copy the aesthetics the
   best you can.
2. Write good commit messages, explain what your patch does, and why it is
   needed.
3. Keep it simple: Any patch that changes a lot of code or is difficult to
   understand should be discussed before you put in the effort.
4. Make sure it works! :)

Once you have tried the above, tou can create a GitHub pull request to notify
us of your changes.
