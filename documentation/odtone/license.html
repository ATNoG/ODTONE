    </h3>
<p>
      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
      General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of
      the GNU General Public License.
    </p>
<p>
      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
      other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
    </p>
<p>
      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
      by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a
      subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
      provided by the Library.
    </p>
<p>
      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
      with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined
      Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".
    </p>
<p>
      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
      Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions
      of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application,
      and not on the Linked Version.
    </p>
<p>
      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
      object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and
      utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application,
      but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
    </p>

      You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
      being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

<p>
      If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
      refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
      facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
      you may convey a copy of the modified version:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>a)</strong></span> under this License, provided that you make
      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply
      the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
      of its purpose remains meaningful, or
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>b)</strong></span> under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
      permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

      Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</a>
    </h3>
<p>
      The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
      file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
      of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited
      to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
      inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both
      of the following:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>a)</strong></span> Give prominent notice with each copy of
      the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
      use are covered by this License.

<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>b)</strong></span> Accompany the object code with a copy of

    </h3>
<p>
      You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
      effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained
      in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications,
      if you also do each of the following:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>a)</strong></span> Give prominent notice with each copy of
      the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
      use are covered by this License.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>b)</strong></span> Accompany the Combined Work with a copy
      of the GNU GPL and this license document.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>c)</strong></span> For a Combined Work that displays copyright
      notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the
      GNU GPL and this license document.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>d)</strong></span> Do one of the following:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>i)</strong></span> Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source
      under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in
      a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
      relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce
      a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
      for conveying Corresponding Source.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>ii)</strong></span> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
      for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at
      run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,
      and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
      interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>e)</strong></span> Provide Installation Information, but only
      if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section
      6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary
      to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
      recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked
      Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
      use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
      specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

      Combined Libraries.</a>
    </h3>
<p>
      You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side
      by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are
      not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
      library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>a)</strong></span> Accompany the combined library with a copy
      of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
      conveyed under the terms of this License.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>b)</strong></span> Give prominent notice with the combined
      library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
      to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

      Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</a>
    </h3>
<p>
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
      be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
      new problems or concerns.
    </p>
<p>
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
      received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
      Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
      option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
      or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
      as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General
      Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
      future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
      proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization
      for you to choose that version for the Library.
